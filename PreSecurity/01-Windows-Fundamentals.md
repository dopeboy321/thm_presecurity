# Task 1 Introduction to Windows

This is a basic introduction to the Windows OS. The main objective is to start the Virtual Machine.
We have two options:

## What is an OS?

An Operating System is the main software that manages all hardware and software on a computer. It acts as a bridge between the machine and the user, allowing programs to run and devices to communicate.

Windows has a long history, dating back to 1985, and is still the dominant operating system in both home and corporate networks. Due to its popularity, Windows OS has always been a target for threat actors.

The authors in this section take us through the history of Windows, up to the latest version, Windows 11.

Windows 10 comes in two versions: Home and Pro. These two versions are different from each other.

The current Windows operating system for servers is Windows Server 2019, and for the attached virtual machine, we also use Windows Server 2019 Standard.

At the end, the authors ask the question:

What encryption can you enable on Pro that you can't enable in Home?

The correct answer is BitLocker.

## What is BitLocker?

BitLocker protects your computer from unauthorized access by encrypting the entire drive. It's the default Windows encryption system and encrypts the C: drive to keep your data safe.
