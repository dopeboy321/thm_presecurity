## Task 1 Introduction to Windows

This is a basic introduction to the Windows OS. The main objective is to start the Virtual Machine.
We have two options:
- Start Machine in the web browser.
- Open Virtual Machine via Remote Desktop and log in with the provided credentials.

I picked the first option and logged in through the web browser.
