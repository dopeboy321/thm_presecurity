# Task 1 Introduction to Windows

This is a basic introduction to the Windows OS. The main objective is to start the Virtual Machine.
We have two options:
- Start Machine in the web browser.
- Open Virtual Machine via Remote Desktop and log in with the provided credentials.

I picked the first option and logged in through the web browser.

# Task 2 Windows Editions

## What is an OS?

An Operating System is the main software that manages all hardware and software on a computer. It acts as a bridge between the machine and the user, allowing programs to run and devices to communicate.

Windows has a long history, dating back to 1985, and is still the dominant operating system in both home and corporate networks. Due to its popularity, Windows OS has always been a target for threat actors.

The authors in this section take us through the history of Windows, up to the latest version, Windows 11.

Windows 10 comes in two versions: Home and Pro. These two versions are different from each other.

The current Windows operating system for servers is Windows Server 2019, and for the attached virtual machine, we also use Windows Server 2019 Standard.

Objective of this task is to answer the question:

**What encryption can you enable on Pro that you can't enable in Home?**

The correct answer is BitLocker.

## What is BitLocker?

BitLocker protects your computer from unauthorized access by encrypting the entire drive. It's the default Windows encryption system and encrypts the C: drive to keep your data safe.

# Task 3 The Desktop (GUI)

## What is GUI?

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) lets users interact with devices through icons and visual elements, instead of typing commands. GUIs were developed to be more user-friendly than Command-Line Interfaces. (CLIs)

## What is CLI?

A Command-Line Interface is a way of interacting with a computer by typing text commands into a terminal or console.

In short:
- GUI = Click buttons
- CLI = Type commands

CLIs are powerful and efficient for advanced users, but they are hard to learn for beginners. This was the reason why GUIs were created!


In this section, the authors provide basic information about the Windows GUI, but I decided not to include that in my notes since I've been a Windows user since I was a kid, I didn't feel the need to include it in my notes.
